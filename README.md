# Simulation of Cache Architecture using Logism

Term project for Computer Architecture and Microprocessors course (CSN-221).
This contains an implementation of the Cache Architecture including all the operations like load, store, write-back, eviction-policy, LRU (With a custom implementation) and other functionalities that are present in the Cache Architecture.
Simulations are being run with the help of a CPU using simple instructions, designed specially for the same. 

Install logisim-
### sudo apt-get install -y logisim

Then open the file and set load, store and put some data in the memory (using the files provided with testcases or with your own custom tests) or cache to test for simulations.
